SMILE DETECTOR

Using CNN (LeNet5) and Haar cascade face detector to detect a face and classify as "smiling" or "not smiling" from a real-time input video stream

Consists of two parts
1. train_model.py - Trains LeNet5 architecture using data augmentation on SMILES dataset which is saved in "data/SMILEsmileD/" downloaded from https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD. The model weights are stored in model/smiles_lenet_epochs20.hdf5

2. detect_smile.py - Takes in the input video stream from "data/" or webcam feed. Extracts face ROI using Haar cascade using OpenCV's implementation in "data/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml". These ROI's are passed to the CNN which predicts smile or no smile.
